            <b>Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, popularly known as the "Missile Man of India," was one of India’s most respected scientists and leaders.</b> Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he grew up in a modest household and demonstrated a passion for learning from an early age.

Dr. Kalam studied physics at St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, and later pursued aeronautical engineering at the Madras Institute of Technology. He began his career at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and later worked at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). At ISRO, he played a pivotal role in developing India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-3), which launched the Rohini satellite in 1980.

A visionary leader, Dr. Kalam contributed significantly to India's nuclear and missile programs, earning him the title "Missile Man." He was an integral part of Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, which bolstered India’s position as a nuclear power.

In 2002, Dr. Kalam became the 11th President of India, serving until 2007. He was affectionately called the "People’s President" for his humble demeanor and dedication to the country. After his presidency, he dedicated his life to teaching, writing, and inspiring young minds, emphasizing the power of education and innovation.

Dr. Kalam received numerous accolades, including the Padma Bhushan (1981), Padma Vibhushan (1990), and Bharat Ratna (1997)—India’s highest civilian honor. He authored several inspirational books, including "Wings of Fire", "Ignited Minds", and "India 2020".

On July 27, 2015, Dr. Kalam passed away while delivering a lecture at IIM Shillong, leaving behind a legacy of inspiration, innovation, and service. His life remains a beacon of hope for millions across the world.
